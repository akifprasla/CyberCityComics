THIS is a project i made for a case study where i had to use an api and display details from it on the web page.

Used NODEJS for backend 

Used Mysql for database 

can navigate using next/prev/random or simple type in the page you wanna visit in the url

Also shows the number of times a particular page has been viewed.
